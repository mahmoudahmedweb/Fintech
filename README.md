# Fintech App Landing Page üåêüí∞

A sleek, modern landing page built for a finance tech application, inspired by an elegant [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/qrtsZUlDOpSK4kLFw7kl9E/Fintech-Website-Landing-Page-Design-(Community)?node-id=285-2071&node-type=frame&t=Mq6dxnPyWZOCrkUC-0) from the Figma Community. 

The design caught my eye, and I decided to fully code it and make it responsive to provide a polished user experience across any device.
